# AutismApp

This was an Android application that me, Asef Sharar Chowdhury and Sheikh Abdul Alim tried to develop as a part of our Top Up IT Training
Program for Android which was held by NASSCOM IT-ITES Sector Skills Council and Bangladesh Computer Council in BRAC University premises
under the Top Up IT project.

Our motivation behind this was to help children affected from autism and their parents so that they can take better care of them. 
Children who are affected by autism follow a rigid routine where they have to get what they want at particular times so that they can be 
satisfied. Therefore, we tried to make an application where their parents can set their schedules and needs and they can follow these
at any particular time.

The application is described by Sheikh Abdul Alim in the YouTube link below. Due to shortage of time and simultaneous academic commitments, it proved to be too difficult for us to finish, as this project was originally based on two applications - one for the parent and the other for the child.
